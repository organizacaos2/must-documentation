## Token Creator

The macro process shows how the create token application works. There are two steps: 

- the **open area**, where the user defines the token and makes its registration; 

- the **logged area**, where the user defines the licenses, the payment method and manages the token.

The application also needs to manage the status of these licenses

![Token Creator](/img/must-create/TokenCreator.png)


In the **open area** the user will define his token, a summary of the token to be created is displayed. After filling in the account registration information, a wallet is created and associated with that user registration.

The setup fee is paid only when creating the token. The purchase of other products after the creation of the token does not include the value of the setup.

After confirmation of payment, the products selected for your plan are available for use.

### Features to Manage Token

To manage the token, an application with the main features is available to the user. Currently it is possible to mint and burn the created token.

![Manage-1](/img/must-create/Manage1.png)

### Manage Licenses  by User

The user can manage his plan by canceling products or adding others at any time.
The cancellation checks the remaining usage time.

![Manage-2](/img/must-create/Manage2.png)

### Plan Accounts Manager

The license management generates the recurring payment and checks whether the license is close to the expiration date to notify the token owner. If the license expires and there is no payment, it is canceled.

## Acceptance criteria

- **An account** can create **multiples tokens** contracts

- Each new account need generate an address to be a owner of the Tokens

- User need fill with e-mail and password to create an account

- Encrypted storage of generated wallet information

- User does not receive private key and mneumonic

- The token symbol need to be unique in the environment

- Create Token smart contracts **ERC-20** standard Ethereum Token, mintable and burnable, Ownable and Pausable

- User buy licences to use the avaliable products

- User need to pay a setup value once

- Each new token need to be a subscribe to a service. Is for token and not for account.

- Deploy only to the mainnet

- Internationalization (PT-BR and English)

- Status to create a Token:

| Status | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Wainting for Payment | Pending confirmation of license payment. |
| Paid | After confirmation of license payment |
| Deployed | After user makes the token deploy. |

## Interface to create and manage Token

- Open area:
    - Form with infos about token creation

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Token Name | String (3 - 25 symbols. Alphanumerical characters, space, and hyphen are accepted.) |
| Token Symbol | String (3-4 letters and need to be unique) |
| Decimals | Integer (0 - 18 integer) |
| Type | Value ERC-20 |
| Total suply | Integer |

- Logged area
    - Manage token application

| Menu | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Menu Dashboard | Card with Information about created token (with details created token) |
| Menu My Plan | Show information about the contracted license |
| Payment Details | List the payment details for each token. |
| My Tokens | List all my created tokens |
| Menu Mint / Burn | Enabled after the token is in active status, user can mint/burn to token created |

## How it Works

Create your Token without code and in a few steps.

![Process](/img/must-create/Process.png)

1. With an intuitive form you provide information about the token you want to create: name, symbol, number of decimal places and the total suply. All information has a clear explanation.

2. You create your account. Whith this account you can manage your Token easily with a intuitive interface.

3. Make the payment. Afther payment confirmation we made deploy 

4. Then start to use

## Process Steps

### Start Create Token

If you want to generate your own token, we have created a tool that will enable you to deploy your own token in a few minutes, without coding skills. You only needs define the name and symbol of the token, as well as initial supply.

### Step1 - Provide Token Information

- Fill the form with information about your Token:
    - **Name** -> the name of your token, it is important to give an identity. 3-25 symbols. Alphanumerical characters, space, and hyphen are accepted.
    - **Symbol** -> the symbol represents your brand, it is usually 3-4 letters and need to be unique
    - **Type** -> ERC-20 is a proposed and widely adopted standard for creating tokens. It's a set of rules implemented in a smart contract that is deployed on the Must network
    - **Decimal places** -> The divisibility will help us determine the lowest possible value of the token.
        A divisibility of 0 will mean that the lowest value of the token is 1.
        A divisibility of 2, on the other hand, means its lowest value will be 0.01.
        The maximum number of decimal places allowed is 18.
    - **Total supply** -> Number of tokens that will exist in the created ecosystem. This amount can be changed according to market needs, and can be increased or decreased (from the Mint and Burn functions respectively)

### Step2 - Provide Interface Information

- The choice of functions defines how your token will work.
All created smart contracts are  **ERC-20** standard Token, mintable and burnable, with owner access permissions and module pausable.

With this Token you can generate more tokens to increse the Total Supply of your token.

| Function | Description | Default ERC-20 |
| -------- | ----------- | :------------: |
| Transfer | Transfers amount of tokens from the callerâ€™s account to recipient. | yes |
| Allowance (approve, increase and decrease) | Checks the limit that an address_spender (approved by the token owner) can spend from _owner. | yes |
| Transfer from | Moves amount tokens from sender to recipient. | yes |
| Balance of | Show the amount of tokens owned by your account | yes |

- **Events** are important because they facilitate communication between smart contracts and their user interfaces.

| Event | Description | Default ERC-20 |
| ----- | ----------- | :------------: |
| Transfer | Emitted when value tokens are moved from one account (from) to another (to). | yes |
| Approval | Emitted when the allowance of a spender for an owner is set by a call to approve. | yes |

### Step3 - Resume Token

- A summary is displayed with the selected information of the token that will be created. It is possible to return and change if necessary.

### Step4 - Register new account

- To access the token management functionality and the other benefits offered, it is necessary to create an account.

### Step5 - Choose the plan
- We provide the best management and control tools for your token in each available plan.

### Step6 - Make the payment

- Choose your payment method

## Payment Management Licenses - Token Creator

### Business Process

After payment confirmation, the user's token enters the management of the purchased licenses.

![BP1](/img/must-create/BP1.png)

The user has control over the licenses purchased for his token. At any time it is possible to add more services or remove. It is at the discretion of the administrator of the Token Creator tool the price conditions of the services offered.

![BP2](/img/must-create/BP2.png)

The Token Creator tool manages license payments daily. Checks payments received and licenses to expire by notifying the user. 

Licenses are prepaid, so Token Creator recalculates the cancellation date to the most appropriate day for the entire paid period to be used.
